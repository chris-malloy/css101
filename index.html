    <!-- BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENTS #### DIVS -->
    <!--     1. A BLOCK level element, by default., takes all the space to the right 
    and to the left possible, internal to it's parent.
    2. It CAN have aheight and a width
    3. NOTHING can ever be on either side (internal to the parent) because it's 100%. 
    If you cahnge the width, it will just add margin, Blocks will ignore margin you add,
    because they are 100%
    4. If you change the size, it will still take up 100%, but the rest outisde
    of the width, will just be more margin -->

    <!-- INLINE ELEMENTS #### SPANS-->
    1. Respect left and right padding, left and right maring, but will ignore top and bottom 2. Couldn't care less what is left or right. 3. With a few exceptions (namely images) you CANNOT tell an inline element how big to be. 4. Will happily ignore all
    block level rules unless told otherwise. INLINE BLOCK 1. Can have stuff on either side 2. Can have height/width (block, positive) 3. Can have top/bottom
